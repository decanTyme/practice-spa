## Purpose of Project

A few months ago this project was used as a practice (as the repo name suggests) when I was learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), among others. I planned it to be usable enough for our small, humble store but I didn't really have the manpower nor the time to fully implement it at the time. 

Although this was a particularly ambitious project to create an Inventory Management System (plus Customer Relations) in solo-mode, I have learned _**greatly**_ from it and now I am releasing it publicly. Things have changed I don't think I'll be continuing this anytime soon, especially when I have already found a more feasible meta-framework for solo projects that handles routes much more elegantly, which was the pain-point of the entire system. Some parts of it have already been used in my other projects.
